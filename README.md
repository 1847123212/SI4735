# Si4735 Library for Arduino

This is a library for the SI4735, BROADCAST AM/FM/SW RADIO RECEIVER,  IC from Silicon Labs for the Arduino development environment.  This library is intended to provide an easier interface for controlling the SI4435.

__The SI4835 is a 3.3V part. If you are not using a +3.3V version of Arduino, you have to use a kind of 5V to 3.3V converter.__
