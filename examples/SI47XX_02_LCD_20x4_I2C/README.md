# Radios based on Si4735 working with LCD20x4 / I2C 


## Si47XX 04 - SI4735_04_ALL_IN_ONE - All in One radio with SSB firmware update support with LCD/I2C

This sketch uses the Rotary Encoder Class implementation from Ben Buxton. The source code is included together with this sketch. Also, will download a SSB patch to your SI4735 device. It will take about 9KB from Arduino Flash Memory.

__This sketch has been successfully tested on:__
* Pro Mini 3.3V; 
* UNO (by using a voltage converter); 
* Arduino YÃºn (by using a voltage converter); 
* Arduino Micro (see the operating voltage of your Micro); 
* Arduino Mega (by using a voltage converter); and 
* Arduino DUE;

Features of this sketch: 

1) __Internal Arduino pull-up (no external resistors on schematic for buttons and encoder)__;
2) Only SSB (LSB and USB);
3) Audio bandwidth filter 0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4Khz;
4) Volume control;
5) Eight ham radio bands pre configured;
6) BFO Control; 
7) Frequency step switch (1, 5 and 10KHz);  and
8) BFO step (10 and 50 Hz)
   

Follow the schematic below to use this sketch.

#### __ABOUT DIGITAL pin 13 and INPUT PULL-UP on Arduino Pro Mini, UNO or similar:__
This pin has a LED and a resistor connected on the board. When this pin is set to HIGH the LED comes on. If you use the internal pull-up resistor of the pin 13, you might experiment problem due to the drop voltage caused by the LED circuit. If this occurs in your project, change the circuit to use external pull-up on pin 13.

Pay attention on the push buttons added on this example. The table below shows the commands used by this sketch.

| Defined constant | Arduino Pin | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| BANDWIDTH_BUTTON | 5           | Used to select the banddwith. Values: 1.2, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5, 1.0 KHz |
| VOL_UP           | 6           | Volume Up |
| VOL_DOWN 7       | 7           | Volume Down |
| BAND_BUTTON_UP   | 8           | Next band |
| BAND_BUTTON_DOWN | 9           | Previous band | 
| AGC_SWITCH       | 11          | Switch AGC ON/OF | 
| STEP_SWITCH      | 10          | Used to select the increment or decrement frequency step (1, 5 or 10 KHz) |
| BFO_SWITCH       | 13          | Used to select the enconder control (BFO or VFO) |


## Si47XX 02 - AM/FM radio with OLCD and OLED as a S-Meter

This example uses two display I2C devices and the Si4735 connected on the same I2C bus. 
It is an simple AM and FM radio. The schematic is the same used on Example 10. See below.

## Si47XX 07 - SW Receiver with LCD and OLED as a S-Meter 

Like the previous example , this example uses two display and the SI4735 connect on the same I2C bus.
This radio has 11 bands.
