## Si47XX 01 - Arduino Library example with I2C OLED

This sketch uses the Rotary Encoder Class implementation from Ben Buxton. The source code is included together with this sketch. This sketch also uses the SSD1306Ascii Arduino Library by Bill Greiman. You can install SSD1306Ascii via Manage Libraries on your Arduino IDE. The photo below show this example on a protoboard. 

__This sketch has been successfully tested on Pro Mini 3.3V.__ 

Click [here](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/blob/master/examples/SI4735_04_OLED_I2C/SI4735_04_OLED_I2C.ino) to see this example.

#### __ABOUT DIGITAL pin 13 and INPUT PULL-UP on Arduino Pro Mini, UNO or similar:__
This pin has a LED and a resistor connected on the board. When this pin is set to HIGH the LED comes on. If you use the internal pull-up resistor of the pin 13, you might experiment problem due to the drop voltage caused by the LED circuit. If this occurs in your project, change the circuit to use external pull-up on pin 13.

The schematic below is a sugestion to connect a I2C Display (OLED or LCD 20x4 or another device), buntons and encoder as well. 

![Schematic for I2C display device](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/blob/master/extras/images/basic_schematic_with_buttons_i2c.png)

__Pay attention to the your I2C device voltage. The system can become unstable if you are using a wrong voltage__.

## Si47XX 02 - Arduino Library example with LCD 20x4 I2C

It is a example that shows how to set up a LCD and SI4735 on the same I2C bus. 
This sketch uses the Rotary Encoder Class implementation from Ben Buxton. The source code is included together with this sketch. This sketch also uses the LiquidCrystal I2C Library by Frank de Brabander. You can install LiquidCrystal I2C via Manage Libraries on your Arduino IDE.

## Si47XX 03 - Bandwidth filter test (11 band SW Receiver with OLED)

This example is a 11 band SW receiver based on SI4735.  It shows the selection of the bandwidth of the channel filter for AM reception (in this case SW). The choices are: 6, 4, 3, 2, 2.5, 1.8, or 1 (kHz). With this resource, you can separate  two stations in adjacent channels. __You can use the same schematic shown for the examples 03 and 04__.

## Si47XX 04 - SSB firmware update support with OLED/I2C

  This sketch uses the Rotary Encoder Class implementation from Ben Buxton. The source code is included together with this sketch. 

  __This sketch has been successfully tested on Pro Mini 3.3V.__ 

  This sketch will download a SSB patch to your SI4735 device (patch_init.h). It will take about 9KB from Arduino Flash Memory.   
    
  In this context, a patch is a piece of software used to change the behavior of the SI4735 device.
  There is little information available about patching the SI4735. The following information is the understanding of the author of 
  this project and it is not necessarily correct. A patch is executed internally (run by internal MCU) of the device. 
  Usually, patches are used to fixes bugs or add improvements and new features of the firmware installed in the internal ROM of the device. 
  Patches to the SI4735 are distributed in binary form and have to be transferred to the internal RAM of the device by 
  the host MCU (in this case Arduino). Since the RAM is volatile memory, the patch stored into the device gets lost when you turn off the system.
  Consequently, the content of the patch has to be transferred again to the device each time after turn on the system or reset the device.

  ATTENTION: The author of this project does not guarantee that procedures shown here will work in your development environment. 
  Given this, it is at your own risk to continue with the procedures suggested here. 
  This library works with the I2C communication protocol and it is designed to apply a SSB extension PATCH to CI SI4735-D60. 
  Once again, the author disclaims any liability for any damage this procedure may cause to your SI4735 or other devices that you are using.  

  Features of this sketch: 

  1) Internal Arduino pull-up (no external resistors on schematic for buttons and encoder);
  2) Only SSB (LSB and USB);
  3) Audio bandwidth filter 0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4Khz;
  4) Eight ham radio bands pre configured;
  5) BFO Control; and
  6) Frequency step switch (1, 5 and 10KHz);

  Main Parts: 
  Encoder with push button; 
  Seven bush buttons;
  OLED Display with I2C protocol;
  Arduino Pro mini 3.3V;  


Pay attention on the push buttons added on this example. The table below shows the commands used by this sketch.

| AGC_SWITCH       | 11          | Switch AGC ON/OF |

## SI47XX 12 - All in One on ESP32

This example is a complete FM/AM/LW/SW (with SSB support) receiver based on SI4735 running on ESP32 
<BR>
__Features:__
1) This sketch has been successfully tested on ESP LOLIN32 (WEMOS);
2) It uses the capacitive touch ESP32 resource;
3) I2C LiquidCrystal/LCD 20x4;
4) Encoder;
5) FM, AM (MW and SW) and SSB (LSB and USB);
6) Audio bandwidth filter 0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4Khz;
7) BFO Control; and
8) Frequency step switch (1, 5 and 10KHz). 
  
To support the SSB mode, This sketch downloads a SSB patch to your SI4735 device (patch_init.h). 
In this context, a patch is a piece of software used to change the behavior of the SI4735 device.
There is little information available about patching the SI4735. The following information is the understanding of the author of this project and it is not necessarily correct.

Once again, the author disclaims any liability for any damage this procedure may cause to your SI4735 or other devices that you are using.

### ESP32 considerations

The ESP32 has a great resource to interact with system. Instead of buttons, you can use the capacitive sensors available on ESP32 IC family. 

The ESP32 is a 3.3V part. Pay attention on your I2C LCD device voltage. If it is not 3.3V, the system cannot work properly.

The ESP32 board has enough RAM memory to support all SSB patch and a nice TFT Display. Consider this feature to improve your sketch.


### Schematic 

You can use the same schematic used on Arduino family. 
However, you have pay attention to the new configuration pins on ESP32. See table bellow.


### ESP-LOLIN32-WEMOS touch capacitive and intterrupt pins

| GPIO   | Used as  | Arduino constant number | Function Description | 
| ------ | -------- | ------------------ | ----------- | 
| GPIO32 | Capacitive | 32 | Switch MODE (Am/LSB/USB) | 
| GPIO33 | Capacitive | 33 | Used to select the banddwith. Values: 1.2, 2.2, 3.0, 4.0, 0.5, 1.0 KHz |
| GPIO27 | Capacitive | 27 | Volume Up |
| GPIO14 | Capacitive | 14 | Volume Down |
| GPIO12 | Capacitive | 12 | Switch to the next band |
| GPIO4  | Capacitive |  4 | Switch to the previous band | 
| GPIO2  | Capacitive |  2 | Used to select the increment or decrement frequency step (1, 5 or 10 KHz)
| GPIO15 | Capacitive | 15 | Used to select the enconder control (BFO or VFO) 
| GPIO17 | Interrupt |  17 | Encoder pin A |
| GPIO16 | Interrupr |  16 | Encoder pin B |




It seams that in some ESP32 board, the I2C bus is not configured prorpelly by default. However, you can set almost any pin on ESP32 to setup I2C capabilities. All you have to do is call __Wire.begin(SDA, SCL);__ where SDA and SCL are the ESP32 GPIO pins. The code below shows that.

```cpp
// I2C bus pin on ESP32
#define ESP32_I2C_SDA 21
#define ESP32_I2C_SCL 22

.
.
.
.

void setup() {


  // The line below may be necessary to setup I2C pins on ESP32
  Wire.begin(ESP32_I2C_SDA, ESP32_I2C_SCL);


}
```



## SI47XX 13 - All in One With TFT Touch Shield on Arduino Mega

This sketch uses the [mcufriend TFT touch](http://www.mcufriend.com) Display on Arduino Mega2580 (2.4" TFT LCD Shield).

  Features:
  1) This sketch has been successfully tested on Arduino Mega2560;
  2) It uses the touch screen interface provided by mcufriend TFT;
  3) Encoder with button;
  4) FM, AM (MW and SW) and SSB (LSB and USB);
  5) Audio bandwidth filter 0.5, 1, 1.2, 2.2, 3 and 4Khz;
  6) BFO Control; and
  7) Frequency step switch (1, 5 and 10KHz).

Before start running this example, you need to calibrate your TFT Touch shield. To do tha, run the example __TouchScreen_Calibr_native.ino__ that comes with Arduino MCUFRIEND_kbv library. That sketch uses the Serial monitor and a own Display to calibrate it. All you have to do is follow the instructions shown by the example (TouchScreen_Calibr_native.ino).
