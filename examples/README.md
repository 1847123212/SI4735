## SS4735 Arduino Library example with LCD 20x4 I2C

This sketch uses the Rotary Encoder Class implementation from Ben Buxton. The source code is included together with this sketch. This sketch also uses the LiquidCrystal I2C Library by Frank de Brabander. You can install LiquidCrystal I2C via Manage Libraries on your Arduino IDE.

## Proof of Concept

I strongly recommend starting with this sketch. This example is a proof of concept of SI4735 Arduino Library. The [SI4735_POC.ino](https://github.com/pu2clr/SI4735/tree/master/examples/SI4735_POC) uses just the __Serial Monitor__ and works only on your __Arduino IDE__. However, you can easily replace the Serial Monitor functions to the device functions that you want to use.
